        We are looking for a UI/UX Figma designer to put together some initial mockups of what some screens in our app would look like. These will primarily be used in user research to understand preferences in features.
        We require a turnaround of 24 hours from the start of the project (TBD this week). We are happy to use template elements or anything that can speed up the job.
        Strong preference given to experience with wearable, sleep or fitness trackers.
